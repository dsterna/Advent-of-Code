Hardest puzzel so far, would have been easier if I skipped to integrate react hooks for some odd reason

*Interfaces can be an arrays of a cusom type

*let intersection = _.intersectionWith(firstTrack, secondTrack, _.isEqual); is a lodash function for getting the intersection of two arrays with objects. This was slow and should be customly implemented with array.filter(compare) where compare is a fucntion that returns -1 or 1 depending on the objects.

*Same problem with second assignment, intersection was hard to determine.
